    <h1 style="color: azure;">History of Pizza</h1>
  </div>

  <div style="text-align: center;">
  <p style="color: azure;">
    The history of pizza begins in antiquity, as various ancient cultures produced basic
     flatbreads with several toppings. <br>
<br>
    A precursor of pizza was probably the focaccia, a flatbread known to the Romans as <br> 
    panis focacius, to which toppings were then added. Modern pizza evolved from similar <br>
     flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th or early 19th century.<br>
    The word pizza was first documented in 997 AD in Gaeta and successively <br>
     in different parts of Central and Southern Italy. Pizza was mainly eaten in <br>
      Italy and by emigrants from there. This changed after World War II when <br>
      Allied troops stationed in Italy came to enjoy pizza along with other Italian foods. <br>

  <p style="color: azure;">
    First established in 1738 as a stand for peddlers, Antica Pizzeria Port'Alba <br>
     was opened in 1830 in the town center at Via Port'Alba. The restaurant replaced <br>
      street vendors who would make pizza in wood-fired ovens and bring it onto the street, <br>
       keeping it warm in small tin stoves they balanced on their head. It soon became a <br>
       prominent meeting place for men in the street. Most patrons were artists, students, <br>
        or others with very little money, so the pizzas made were generally simple, with <br>
         toppings such as oil and garlic. A payment system, called pizza a otto, was <br>
          developed that allowed customers to pay up to eight days after their meal. <br>
           A resulting local joke was that a meal from Port'Alba might be someone's last free meal, <br> 
           if they died before they paid. Additionally, patrons created poetry to honor the pizzas. <br>
            Antica Pizzeria Port'Alba is still in business today, located between a number of bookstores. <br>
             It is widely believed to be the world's first pizzeria. <br>
